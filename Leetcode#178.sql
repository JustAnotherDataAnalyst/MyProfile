Question - 
------------------
Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+

Solution â€“

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select score, dense_rank() over ( order by score desc) as Rank
from Scores


Explanation - 

Step 1 : Identify what data is present in the table.
Step 2 : Put special emphasis on the keywords - "Order by highest score"
Step 3 : Build the query using dense_rank() and not rank() because the latter skips ranks incase of duplicate or tied records and we see that a socre of 3.85 is given 
		 rank 2 after rank 1 is tied . [Refer - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/ranking-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017] 
Step 4 : Build the query and execute.
